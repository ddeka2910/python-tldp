  * continue improving coverage, at 100% on utils.py
  * complete CascadingConfig object creation

2016-02-26 Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>
  * generate a DAG for each processor class, so dependencies can
    be localized (controlled, abstracted) to each processor class

    which leads to massive simplification of the generate() method
  * user can specify explicit file to process
  * better PDF generation logic (relying on jw)
  * provide support for --script outputs (logical equiv. of --dryrun)
  * if a document processor is missing prerequisites, gripe to logging
    and skip to the next document
  * support a SourceDocument named by its directory
  * add timing to each processor (some documents take minutes to process,
    others just a few seconds; good for users trying to understand which...)

  * adding ArgumentParser wrapper so can support config file + envars
  * all sorts of work for support cascading configuration
  * allow each processor to have its own configuration fragment, e.g.
    --docbook4xml-xmllint; owned by the Docbook4XML object

2016-02-19 Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>

2016-02-18 Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>
  * process and report on documents in case-insensitive stem-sorted order
  * add many docstrings for internal usage
  * move all source directory scanning logic out of the SourceCollection
    object; easier to test and simpler to understand

2016-02-17 Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>
  * add logic for testing file age, assuming a fresh checkout of the
    source documents; use filesystem age to determine whether or not
    a document rebuild is necessary
  * initial support for driver.py (eventually, the main user entry point
    and inventory.py (for managing the identification and pairing of
    source and output documents)

    stems, sample valid and broken documents

2016-02-15 Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>
  * first processor, Linuxdoc, reaches success
  * provide better separation between a SourceCollection and the
    individual SourceDocuments; analogously, between OutputDirectory
    and OutputCollection

    OutputCollection (which is known to the user as --pubdir)

2016-02-12 Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>
  * first processor, Linuxdoc, fleshed out, created (failed)
