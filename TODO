python-tldp TODO
----------------

  * Add a verb to produce a runnable shell-script instead of having 
    ldptool do the job.

  * SourceDocument and OutputDirectory both have nearly-identical
    methods called detail() which define a format string; probably
    should be defined once in a parent class or something

  * add a manpage

  * figure out how/if to build the outputs in a separate place
    rather than in the real output directory

  * smart_bool for config handling

CascadingConfig
---------------

  * factor out CascadingConfig into its own project
