python-tldp TODO
----------------

  * SourceDocument and OutputDirectory both have nearly-identical
    methods called detail() which define a format string; probably
    should be defined once in a parent class or something

  * Add a verb to produce a runnable shell-script instead of having 
    ldptool do the job.

  * Copy images into the output directory.

  * DocBookSGML: post-build hook (even if build failure) make sure to remove
    the generated index.sgml from the source directory [clean up after
    yourself!]

CascadingConfig
---------------

  * factor out CascadingConfig into its own project
