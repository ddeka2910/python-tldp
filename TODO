python-tldp TODO
----------------

  * SourceDocument and OutputDirectory both have nearly-identical
    methods called detail() which define a format string; probably
    should be defined once in a parent class or something

  * produce a runnable shell-script instead of calling the programs


CascadingConfig
---------------

  * factor out CascadingConfig into its own project

  * allow automatic detection of config_fragment() functions
