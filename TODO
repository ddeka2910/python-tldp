python-tldp TODO
----------------

  * SourceDocument and OutputDirectory both have nearly-identical
    methods called detail() which define a format string; probably
    should be defined once in a parent class or something

  * Test out on Ubuntu (and any other conveniently accessible platforms).

  * Packaging.

  * Consider adding --skip broken, --skip docbook4xml, ...

  * Add a verb to produce a runnable shell-script instead of having 
    ldptool do the job.


CascadingConfig
---------------

  * factor out CascadingConfig into its own project
